        <h>Family and Childhood</h>
        <p>
            Jinnah's given name at birth was Mahomedali Jinnahbhai, and he likely was born in 1876, to Jinnahbhai Poonja and his wife Mithibai, in a rented apartment on the second floor of Wazir Mansion near Karachi,now in Sindh, Pakistan but then within the Bombay Presidency of British India. Jinnah's family was from a Gujarati Khoja Shi’a Muslim background, though Jinnah later followed the Twelver Shi'a teachings.After his death, his relatives and other witnesses claimed that he had converted in later life to the Sunni sect.

        <p>In 1892, Sir Frederick Leigh Croft, a business associate of Jinnahbhai Poonja, offered young Jinnah a London apprenticeship with his firm, Graham's Shipping and Trading Company.He accepted the position despite the opposition of his mother, who before he left, had him enter an arranged marriage with his cousin, two years his junior from the ancestral village of Paneli, Emibai Jinnah. Jinnah's mother and first wife both died during his absence in England.Although the apprenticeship in London was considered a great opportunity for Jinnah</p>

            At the age of 20, Jinnah began his practice in Bombay, the only Muslim barrister in the city.English had become his principal language and would remain so throughout his life. His first three years in the law, from 1897 to 1900, brought him few briefs. His first step towards a brighter career occurred when the acting Advocate General of Bombay, John Molesworth MacPherson, invited Jinnah to work from his chambers.In 1900, P. H. Dastoor, a Bombay presidency magistrate, left the post temporarily and Jinnah succeeded in getting the interim position. After his six-month appointment period, Jinnah was offered a permanent position on a 1,500 rupee per month salary. Jinnah politely declined the offer, stating that he planned to earn 1,500 rupees a day—a huge sum at that time—which he eventually did. Nevertheless, as Governor-General of Pakistan, he would refuse to accept a large salary, fixing it at 1 rupee per month.

        <p>
            In 1857, many Indians had risen in revolt against British rule. In the aftermath of the conflict, some Anglo-Indians, as well as Indians in Britain, called for greater self-government for the subcontinent, resulting in the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885. Most founding members had been educated in Britain, and were content with the minimal reform efforts being made by the government. Muslims were not enthusiastic about calls for democratic institutions in British India, as they constituted a quarter to a third of the population, outnumbered by the Hindus. Early meetings of the Congress contained a minority of Muslims, mostly from the elite.
            He was a member of the moderate group in the Congress, favouring Hindu–Muslim unity in achieving self-government, and following such leaders as Mehta, Naoroji, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale
            They were opposed by leaders such as Tilak and   In 1906, a delegation of Muslim leaders, known as the Simla Delegation, headed by the Aga Khan called on the new , to assure him of their loyalty and to ask for assurances that in any political reforms they would be protected from the "unsympathetic [Hindu] majority".
            Dissatisfied with this, Jinnah wrote a letter to the editor of the newspaper , asking what right the members of the delegation had to speak for Indian Muslims, as they were unelected and self-appointed.

        <p>
            The early 1930s saw a resurgence in Indian Muslim nationalism, which came 
            to a head with the Pakistan Declaration. In 1933, Indian Muslims, 
            especially from the United Provinces, began to urge Jinnah to return and 
            take up again his leadership of the Muslim League, an organisation which 
            had fallen into inactivity. He remained titular president of the 
            League, but declined to travel to India to preside over its 1933 
            session in April, writing that he could not possibly return there until 
            the end of the year.Among those who met with Jinnah to seek his return was
            Liaquat Ali Khan, who would be a major political associate of Jinnah in
            the years to come and the first Prime Minister of Pakistan. At Jinnah's
            request, Liaquat discussed the return with a large number of Muslim
            politicians and confirmed his recommendation to Jinnah.In early 1934, 
            Jinnah relocated to the subcontinent, though he shuttled between London 
            and India on business for the next few years, selling his house in 
            Hampstead and closing his legal practice in Britain.Muslims of Bombay 
            elected Jinnah, though then absent in London, as their representative to 
            the Central Legislative Assembly in October 1934.The British Parliament's 
            Government of India Act 1935 gave considerable power to India's provinces,
            with a weak central parliament in New Delhi, which had no authority over 
            
            such matters as foreign policy, defence, and much of the budget. Full power 
            mained in the hands of the Viceroy, however, who could dissolve legislatures
            and rule by decree. The League reluctantly accepted the scheme, though 
            expressing reservations about the weak parliament. The Congress was much 
            better prepared for the provincial elections in 1937, and the League failed 
            to win a majority even of the Muslim seats in any of the provinces where 
            members of that faith held a majority. It did win a majority of the Muslim 
            seats in Delhi, but could not form a government anywhere, though it was part
             of the ruling coalition in Bengal. The Congress and its allies formed the 
             government even in the North-West Frontier Province (N.W.F.P.), where the 
             League won no seats despite the fact that almost all residents were Muslim.

        <h1>Struggle for PAKISTAN</h1>
        <hr>
        <strong><h>Background to independence</h></strong>
        <p>
            Until the late 1930s, most Muslims of the British Raj expected, 
            upon independence, to be part of a unitary state encompassing all 
            of British India, as did the Hindus and others who advocated 
            self-government. Despite this, other nationalist proposals 
            were being made. In a speech given at Allahabad to a League 
            session in 1930, Sir Muhammad Iqbal called for a state for Muslims 
            n British India. Choudhary Rahmat Ali published a pamphlet in 1933 
            advocating a state "Pakistan" in the Indus Valley, with other names 
            given to Muslim-majority areas elsewhere in India.Jinnah and Iqbal 
            corresponded in 1936 and 1937; in subsequent years, Jinnah credited 
            Iqbal as his mentor, and used Iqbal's imagery and rhetoric in his 
            speeches.Although many leaders of the Congress sought a strong 
            central government for an Indian state, some Muslim politicians, 
            including Jinnah, were unwilling to accept this without powerful 
            protections for their community.Other Muslims supported the 
            Congress, which officially advocated a secular state upon 
            independence, though the traditionalist wing (including politicians
             such as Madan Mohan Malaviya and Vallabhbhai Patel) believed 
             that an independent India should enact laws such as banning the 
             killing of cows and making Hindi a national language. The failure 
             of the Congress leadership to disavow Hindu communalists worried 
             Congress-supporting Muslims. Nevertheless, the Congress enjoyed 
             considerable Muslim support up to about 1937.

             <strong><h>Iqbal Jinnah influence</h></strong>
             <p>
                The well documented influence of Iqbal on Jinnah, with regard 
                to taking the lead in creating Pakistan, has been described 
                as "significant", "powerful" and even "unquestionable" by 
                scholars.Iqbal has also been cited as an 
                influential force in convincing Jinnah to end his self-imposed
                exile in London and re-enter the politics of India.Initially,
                owever, Iqbal and Jinnah were opponents, as Iqbal believed 
                Jinnah did not care about the crises confronting the Muslim 
                community during the British Raj. According to Akbar S. Ahmed, 
                this began to change during Iqbal's final years prior to his 
                death in 1938. Iqbal gradually succeeded in converting Jinnah 
                over to his view, who eventually accepted Iqbal as his "mentor". 
                Ahmed comments that in his annotations to Iqbal's letters, Jinnah 
                expressed solidarity with Iqbal's view: that Indian Muslims required
                a separate homeland.Iqbal's influence also gave Jinnah a deeper 
                appreciation for Muslim identity. The evidence of this influence 
                began to be revealed from 1937 onwards. Jinnah not only began to echo 
                Iqbal in his speeches, he started using Islamic symbolism and began 
                directing his addresses to the underprivileged. Ahmed noted a change 
                in Jinnah's words: while he still advocated freedom of religion and 
                protection of the minorities, the model he was now aspiring to was 
                that of the Prophet Muhammad, rather than that of a secular politician.
                Ahmed further avers that those scholars who have painted the later 
                Jinnah as secular have misread his speeches which, he argues, 
                must be read in the context of Islamic history and culture. 
                Accordingly, Jinnah's imagery of the Pakistan began to become 
                clear that it was to have an Islamic nature. This change has been 
                seen to last for the rest of Jinnah's life. He continued to borrow 
                ideas "directly from Iqbal—including his thoughts on Muslim unity, 
                on Islamic ideals of liberty, justice and equality, on economics, and 
                even on practices such as prayers".In a speech in 1940, two years 
                after the death of Iqbal, Jinnah expressed his preference for 
                implementing Iqbal's vision for an Islamic Pakistan even 
                if it meant he himself would never lead a nation. Jinnah 
                stated, "If I live to see the ideal of a Muslim state being 
                achieved in India, and I was then offered to make a choice 
                between the works of Iqbal and the rulership of the Muslim 
                state, I would prefer the former."
                
                <address class="iqbaladdress">
                    There is only one way out. Muslims should strengthen 
                    Jinnah's hands. They should join the Muslim League. 
                    Indian question, as is now being solved, can be countered 
                    by our united front against both the Hindus and the 
                    English. Without it, our demands are not going to be 
                    accepted. People say our demands smack of communalism. 
                    This is sheer propaganda. These demands relate to the 
                    defense of our national existence.... The united front can 
                    be formed under the leadership of the Muslim League. And 
                    the Muslim League can succeed only on account of Jinnah. 
                    Now none but Jinnah is capable of leading the Muslims.<br>

                On 3 September 1939, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain announced the commencement of war with Nazi Germany. The following day, the Viceroy, 
Lord Linlithgow, without consulting Indian political leaders, announced that India had entered the war along with Britain. There were widespread protests in 
India. After meeting with Jinnah and with Gandhi, Linlithgow announced that negotiations on self-government were suspended for the duration of the war. 
The Congress on 14 September demanded immediate independence with a constituent assembly to decide a constitution; when this was refused, its eight provincial 
governments resigned on 10 November and governors in those provinces thereafter ruled by decree for the remainder of the war. Jinnah, on the other hand, was more 
willing to accommodate the British, and they in turn increasingly recognised him and the League as the representatives of India's Muslims.Jinnah later stated, 
"after the war began, ... I was treated on the same basis as Mr Gandhi. I was wonderstruck why I was promoted and given a place side by side with Mr Gandhi." 
Although the League did not actively support the British war effort, neither did they try to obstruct it.<br><br>Jinnah and Gandhi arguing in 1939
With the British and Muslims to some extent co-operating, the Viceroy asked Jinnah for an expression of the Muslim League's position on self-government, 
confident that it would differ greatly from that of the Congress. To come up with such a position, the League's Working Committee met for four days in 
February 1940 to set out terms of reference to a constitutional sub-committee. The Working Committee asked that the sub-committee return with a proposal 
that would result in "independent dominions in direct relationship with Great Britain" where Muslims were dominant.On 6 February, Jinnah informed the Viceroy t
hat the Muslim League would be demanding partition instead of the federation contemplated in the 1935 Act. The Lahore Resolution (sometimes called the "Pakistan 
Resolution", although it does not contain that name), based on the sub-committee's work, embraced the Two-Nation Theory and called for a union of the Muslim-majority 
provinces in the northwest of British India, with complete autonomy. Similar rights were to be granted to the Muslim-majority areas in the east, and unspecified 
protections given to Muslim minorities in other provinces. The resolution was passed by the League session in Lahore on 23 March 1940.<br><br>Jinnah makes a speech in 
NewDelhi, 1943 Gandhi's reaction to the Lahore Resolution was muted; he called it "baffling", but told his disciples that Muslims, in common with other people of I
ndia, had the right to self-determination. Leaders of the Congress were more vocal; Jawaharlal Nehru referred to Lahore as "Jinnah's fantastic proposals" while 
Chakravarti Rajagopalachari deemed Jinnah's views on partition "a sign of a diseased mentality". Linlithgow met with Jinnah in June 1940,soon after Winston Churchill 
became the British prime minister, and in August offered both the Congress and the League a deal whereby in exchange for full support for the war, Linlithgow would
allow Indian representation on his major war councils. The Viceroy promised a representative body after the war to determine India's future, and that no future 
settlement would be imposed over the objections of a large part of the population. This was satisfactory to neither the Congress nor the League, though Jinnah was 
pleased that the British had moved towards recognising Jinnah as the representative of the Muslim community's interests. Jinnah was reluctant to make specific
proposals as to the boundaries of Pakistan, or its relationships with Britain and with the rest of the subcontinent, fearing that any precise plan would divide the 
League.<br><br>The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 brought the United States into the war. In the following months, the Japanese advanced in Southeast
Asia, and the British Cabinet sent a mission led by Sir Stafford Cripps to try to conciliate the Indians and cause them to fully back the war. Cripps proposed giving 
some provinces what was dubbed the "local option" to remain outside of an Indian central government either for a period of time or permanently, to become dominions on 
their own or be part of another confederation. The Muslim League was far from certain of winning the legislative votes that would be required for mixed provinces such
as Bengal and Punjab to secede, and Jinnah rejected the proposals as not sufficiently recognising Pakistan's right to exist. The Congress also rejected the Cripps 
plan, demanding immediate concessions which Cripps was not prepared to give.Despite the rejection, Jinnah and the League saw the Cripps proposal as recognising 
Pakistan in principle.<br><br>Jinnah with Mahatma Gandhi in Bombay, 1944 The Congress followed the failed Cripps mission by demanding, in August 1942, that the British 
immediately "Quit India", proclaiming a mass campaign of satyagraha until they did. The British promptly arrested most major leaders of the Congress and imprisoned 
them for the remainder of the war. Gandhi, however, was placed on house arrest in one of the Aga Khan's palaces prior to his release for health reasons in 1944. With 
the Congress leaders absent from the political scene, Jinnah warned against the threat of Hindu domination and maintained his Pakistan demand without going into great
detail about what that would entail. Jinnah also worked to increase the League's political control at the provincial level. He helped to found the newspaper Dawn in 
the early 1940s in Delhi; it helped to spread the League's message and eventually became the major English-language newspaper of Pakistan.<br><br>In September 1944, 
Jinnah and Gandhi, who had by then been released from his palatial prison, met formally at the Muslim leader's home on Malabar Hill in Bombay. Two weeks of talks 
followed between them, which resulted in no agreement. Jinnah insisted on Pakistan being conceded prior to the British departure and to come into being immediately, 
while Gandhi proposed that plebiscites on partition occur sometime after a united India gained its independence. In early 1945, Liaquat and the Congress leader 
Bhulabhai Desai met, with Jinnah's approval, and agreed that after the war, the Congress and the League should form an interim government with the members of the 
Executive Council of the Viceroy to be nominated by the Congress and the League in equal numbers. When the Congress leadership were released from prison in June 1945, 
they repudiated the agreement and censured Desai for acting without proper authority.

                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Mountbatten_Jinnah.jpg" alt="Mount batten" class="barrister">
                On 20 February 1947, Attlee announced Mountbatten's appointment, and that Britain would transfer power in India not later than June 1948. 
Mountbatten took office as Viceroy on 24 March 1947, two days after his arrival in India. By then, the Congress had come around to the idea of partition.
Nehru stated in 1960, "the truth is that we were tired men and we were getting on in years ... The plan for partition offered a way out and we took it."
Leaders of the Congress decided that having loosely tied Muslim-majority provinces as part of a future India was not worth the loss of the powerful government at
the centre which they desired. However, the Congress insisted that if Pakistan were to become independent, Bengal and Punjab would have to be divided.<br>Lord Louis Mountbatten and his wife Edwina Mountbatten with Jinnah in 1947
Mountbatten had been warned in his briefing papers that Jinnah would be his "toughest customer" who had proved a chronic nuisance because "no one in this country
[India] had so far gotten into Jinnah's mind". The men met over six days beginning on 5 April. The sessions began lightly when Jinnah, photographed between
Louis and Edwina Mountbatten, quipped "A rose between two thorns" which the Viceroy took, perhaps gratuitously, as evidence that the Muslim leader had pre-planned
his joke but had expected the vicereine to stand in the middle. Mountbatten was not favourably impressed with Jinnah, repeatedly expressing frustration to his
staff about Jinnah's insistence on Pakistan in the face of all argument.<br><br>Jinnah feared that at the end of the British presence in the subcontinent, 
they would turn control over to the Congress-dominated constituent assembly, putting Muslims at a disadvantage in attempting to win autonomy. He demanded 
that Mountbatten divide the army prior to independence, which would take at least a year. Mountbatten had hoped that the post-independence arrangements would 
include a common defence force, but Jinnah saw it as essential that a sovereign state should have its own forces. <strong><cite class="mount">Lord Mountbatten_____</cite></strong>Mountbatten met with Liaquat the day of his 
final session with Jinnah, and concluded, as he told Attlee and the Cabinet in May, that "it had become clear that the Muslim League would resort to arms if 
Pakistan in some form were not conceded."The Viceroy was also influenced by negative Muslim reaction to the constitutional report of the assembly, 
which envisioned broad powers for the post-independence central government.<br><br>On 2 June, the final plan was given by the Viceroy to Indian leaders: on 15 August,
the British would turn over power to two dominions. The provinces would vote on whether to continue in the existing constituent assembly or to have a new one, that 
is, to join Pakistan. Bengal and Punjab would also vote, both on the question of which assembly to join, and on the partition. A boundary commission would determine 
the final lines in the partitioned provinces. Plebiscites would take place in the North-West Frontier Province (which did not have a League government despite an 
overwhelmingly Muslim population), and in the majority-Muslim Sylhet district of Assam, adjacent to eastern Bengal. On 3 June, Mountbatten, Nehru, Jinnah and Sikh 
leader Baldev Singh made the formal announcement by radio.Jinnah concluded his address with "Pakistan Zindabad " (Long live Pakistan), which was not in the script.
In the weeks which followed Punjab and Bengal cast the votes which resulted in partition. Sylhet and the N.W.F.P. voted to cast their lots with Pakistan, a 
decision joined by the assemblies in Sind and Baluchistan.<br><br>On 4 July 1947, Liaquat asked Mountbatten on Jinnah's behalf to recommend to the British king, 
eorge VI, that Jinnah be appointed Pakistan's first governor-general. This request angered Mountbatten, who had hoped to have that position in both dominions—he 
would be India's first post-independence governor-general—but Jinnah felt that Mountbatten would be likely to favour the new Hindu-majority state because of his c
loseness to Nehru. In addition, the governor-general would initially be a powerful figure, and Jinnah did not trust anyone else to take that office. Although the
Boundary Commission, led by British lawyer Sir Cyril Radcliffe, had not yet reported, there were already massive movements of populations between the nations-to-be, 
as well as sectarian violence. Jinnah arranged to sell his house in Bombay and procured a new one in Karachi. On 7 August, Jinnah, with his sister and close staff, 
flew from Delhi to Karachi in Mountbatten's plane, and as the plane taxied, he was heard to murmur, "That's the end of that."On 11 August, he presided over the new
constituent assembly for Pakistan at Karachi, and addressed them, "You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any 
other place of worship in this State of Pakistan ... You may belong to any religion or caste or creed—that has nothing to do with the business of the State ... I 
think we should keep that in front of us as our ideal and you will find that in course of time Hindus would cease to be Hindus and Muslims would cease to be Muslims, 
not in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political sense as citizens of the State." On 14 August, Pakistan 
became independent; Jinnah led the celebrations in Karachi. One observer wrote, "here indeed is Pakistan's King Emperor, Archbishop of Canterbury, Speaker and Prime
Minister concentrated into one formidable Quaid-e-Azam."

                The Radcliffe Commission, dividing Bengal and Punjab, completed its work and reported to Mountbatten on 12 August; the last Viceroy held the maps until the 17th,
not wanting to spoil the independence celebrations in both nations. There had already been ethnically charged violence and movement of populations; publication of the
Radcliffe Line dividing the new nations sparked mass migration, murder, and ethnic cleansing. Many on the "wrong side" of the lines fled or were murdered, or 
murdered others, hoping to make facts on the ground which would reverse the commission's verdict. Radcliffe wrote in his report that he knew that neither side would
be happy with his award; he declined his fee for the work.Christopher Beaumont, Radcliffe's private secretary, later wrote that Mountbatten "must take the 
blame—though not the sole blame—for the massacres in the Punjab in which between 500,000 to a million men, women and children perished". As many as 14,500,000
people relocated between India and Pakistan during and after partition.Jinnah did what he could for the eight million people who migrated to Pakistan; although by
now over 70 and frail from lung ailments, he travelled across West Pakistan and personally supervised the provision of aid.According to Ahmed, "What Pakistan needed
desperately in those early months was a symbol of the state, one that would unify people and give them the courage and resolve to succeed."<br>Among the restive 
regions of the new nation was the North-West Frontier Province. The referendum there in July 1947 had been tainted by low turnout as less than 10 per cent of the 
population were allowed to vote. On 22 August 1947, just after a week of becoming governor general, Jinnah dissolved the elected government of Dr. Khan Abdul
Jabbar Khan.Later on, Abdul Qayyum Khan was put in place by Jinnah in the Pashtun-dominated province despite him being a Kashmiri. On 12 August 1948 the Babrra 
massacre in Charsadda occurred resulting in the death of 400 people aligned with the Khudai Khidmatgar movement.<br><br>Along with Liaquat and Abdur Rab Nishtar, 
Jinnah represented Pakistan's interests in the Division Council to appropriately divide public assets between India and Pakistan. Pakistan was supposed
to receive one-sixth of the pre-independence government's assets, carefully divided by agreement, even specifying how many sheets of paper each side would 
receive. The new Indian state, however, was slow to deliver, hoping for the collapse of the nascent Pakistani government, and reunion. Few members of the Indian 
Civil Service and the Indian Police Service had chosen Pakistan, resulting in staff shortages. Partition meant that for some farmers, the markets to sell their 
crops were on the other side of an international border. There were shortages of machinery, not all of which was made in Pakistan. In addition to the massive 
refugee problem, the new government sought to save abandoned crops, establish security in a chaotic situation, and provide basic services. According to economist
Yasmeen Niaz Mohiuddin in her study of Pakistan,<address class="iqbaladdress"> "although Pakistan was born in bloodshed and turmoil, it survived in the initial and difficult months after 
partition only because of the tremendous sacrifices made by its people and the selfless efforts of its great leader."</address><br>Jinnah speaking at the Constituent 
Assembly of Pakistan on 14 August 1947<br><br>The Indian Princely States were advised by the departing British to choose whether to join Pakistan or India. Most did so 
prior to independence, but the holdouts contributed to what have become lasting divisions between the two nations. Indian leaders were angered at Jinnah's
attempts to convince the princes of Jodhpur, Udaipur, Bhopal and Indore to accede to Pakistan—the latter three princely states did not border Pakistan. Jodhpur
bordered it and had both a Hindu majority population and a Hindu ruler. The coastal princely state of Junagadh, which had a majority-Hindu population, did
accede to Pakistan in September 1947, with its ruler's dewan, Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, personally delivering the accession papers to Jinnah. But the two states 
that were subject to the suzerainty of Junagadh—Mangrol and Babariawad—declared their independence from Junagadh and acceded to India. In response, the nawab of
Junagadh militarily occupied the two states. Subsequently, the Indian army occupied the principality in November,forcing its former leaders, including Bhutto,
to flee to Pakistan, beginning the politically powerful Bhutto family.<br><br>The most contentious of the disputes was, and continues to be, that over the princely 
state of Kashmir. It had a Muslim-majority population and a Hindu maharaja, Sir Hari Singh, who stalled his decision on which nation to join. With the population
in revolt in October 1947, aided by Pakistani irregulars, the maharaja acceded to India; Indian troops were airlifted in. Jinnah objected to this action, and 
ordered that Pakistani troops move into Kashmir. The Pakistani Army was still commanded by British officers, and the commanding officer, General Sir Douglas
Gracey, refused the order, stating that he would not move into what he considered the territory of another nation without approval from higher authority,
which was not forthcoming. Jinnah withdrew the order. This did not stop the violence there, which broke into Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.<br><br>Some historians allege 
that Jinnah's courting the rulers of Hindu-majority states and his gambit with Junagadh are evidence of ill-intent towards India, as Jinnah had promoted separation
by religion, yet tried to gain the accession of Hindu-majority states.[185] In his book Patel: A Life, Rajmohan Gandhi asserts that Jinnah hoped for a plebiscite 
in Junagadh, knowing Pakistan would lose, in the hope the principle would be established for Kashmir. However, when Mountbatten proposed to Jinnah that, in all 
the princely States where the ruler did not accede to a Dominion corresponding to the majority population (which would have included Junagadh, Hyderabad and Kashmir),
the accession should be decided by an 'impartial reference to the will of the people', Jinnah rejected the offer.Despite the United Nations Security 
Council Resolution 47, issued at India's request for a plebiscite in Kashmir after the withdrawal of Pakistani forces, this has never occurred.<br><br>br>In January 1948, 
the Indian government finally agreed to pay Pakistan its share of British India's assets. They were impelled by Gandhi, who threatened a fast until death. Only days 
later, on 30 January, Gandhi was assassinated by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, who believed that Gandhi was pro-Muslim. After hearing about Gandhi's murder on 
the following day, Jinnah publicly made a brief statement of condolence, calling Gandhi "one of the greatest men produced by the Hindu community".<br><br>In February 1948,
in a radio talk broadcast addressed to the people of the US,Jinnah expressed his views regarding Pakistan's constitution to be in the following way:<address class="iqbaladdress">
The Constitution of Pakistan is yet to be framed by the Pakistan Constituent Assembly, I do not know what the ultimate shape of the constitution is going to be, 
but I am sure that it will be of a democratic type, embodying the essential principles of Islam. Today these are as applicable in actual life as these were 1300 
years ago. Islam and its idealism have taught us democracy. It has taught equality of man, justice and fair play to everybody. We are the inheritors of these 
glorious traditions and are fully alive to our responsibilities and obligations as framers of the future constitution of Pakistan.</address><br><br>
In March, Jinnah, despite his declining health, made his only post-independence visit to East Pakistan. In a speech before a crowd estimated at 300,000, 
Jinnah stated (in English) that Urdu alone should be the national language, believing a single language was needed for a nation to remain united. The 
Bengali-speaking people of East Pakistan strongly opposed this policy, and in 1971 the official language issue was a factor in the region's secession to f
orm the country of Bangladesh.

                From the 1930s, Jinnah suffered from tuberculosis; only his sister and a few others close to him were aware of his condition. Jinnah believed public knowledge of
his lung ailments would hurt him politically. In a 1938 letter, he wrote to a supporter that "you must have read in the papers how during my tours ... I 
suffered, which was not because there was anything wrong with me, but the irregularities [of the schedule] and over-strain told upon my health". 
Many years later, Mountbatten stated that if he had known Jinnah was so physically ill, he would have stalled, hoping Jinnah's death would avert partition.
Fatima Jinnah later wrote, "even in his hour of triumph, the Quaid-e-Azam was gravely ill ... He worked in a frenzy to consolidate Pakistan. And, of course,
he totally neglected his health ..." Jinnah worked with a tin of Craven "A" cigarettes at his desk, of which he had smoked 50 or more a day for the previous
30 years, as well as a box of Cuban cigars. As his health got worse, he took longer and longer rest breaks in the private wing of Government House in Karachi,
where only he, Fatima and the servants were allowed.
<br><br>
In June 1948, he and Fatima flew to Quetta, in the mountains of Balochistan, where the weather was cooler than in Karachi. He could not completely rest there, 
addressing the officers at the Command and Staff College saying, "you, along with the other Forces of Pakistan, are the custodians of the life, property and honour
of the people of Pakistan."He returned to Karachi for 1 July opening ceremony for the State Bank of Pakistan, at which he spoke. A reception by the Canadian trade
commissioner that evening in honour of Dominion Day was the last public event he attended.

On 6 July 1948, Jinnah returned to Quetta, but at the advice of doctors, soon journeyed to an even higher retreat at Ziarat.
Jinnah had always been reluctant to undergo medical treatment, but realising his condition was getting worse, the Pakistani 
government sent the best doctors it could find to treat him. Tests confirmed tuberculosis, and also showed evidence of advanced
lung cancer. He was treated with the new "miracle drug" of streptomycin, but it did not help. Jinnah's condition continued to
deteriorate despite the Eid prayers of his people. He was moved to the lower altitude of Quetta on 13 August, the eve of Independence Day,
for which a ghost-written statement for him was released. Despite an increase in appetite (he then weighed just over 36 kilograms or 79 pounds),
it was clear to his doctors that if he was to return to Karachi in life, he would have to do so very soon. Jinnah, however, was reluctant to go,
not wishing his aides to see him as an invalid on a stretcher.
<br><br>
By 9 September, Jinnah had also developed pneumonia. Doctors urged him to return to Karachi, where he could receive better care, and with his agreement, 
he was flown there on the morning of 11 September. Dr. Ilahi Bux, his personal physician, believed that Jinnah's change of mind was caused by foreknowledge 
of death. The plane landed at Karachi that afternoon, to be met by Jinnah's limousine, and an ambulance into which Jinnah's stretcher was placed. The ambulance 
broke down on the road into town, and the Governor-General and those with him waited for another to arrive; he could not be placed in the car as he could not sit
up. They waited by the roadside in oppressive heat as trucks and buses passed by, unsuitable for transporting the dying man and with their occupants not knowing
of Jinnah's presence. After an hour, the replacement ambulance came, and transported Jinnah to Government House, arriving there over two hours after the landing.
Jinnah died later that night at 10:20 pm at his home in Karachi on 11 September 1948 at the age of 71, just over a year after Pakistan's creation.
<br><br>
Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru stated upon Jinnah's death, "How shall we judge him? I have been very angry with him often during the past years. But now 
there is no bitterness in my thought of him, only a great sadness for all that has been ... he succeeded in his quest and gained his objective, but at what a cost
and with what a difference from what he had imagined." Jinnah was buried on 12 September 1948 amid official mourning in both India and Pakistan; a million
people gathered for his funeral. Indian Governor-General Rajagopalachari cancelled an official reception that day in honour of the late leader. Today, Jinnah rests
in a large marble mausoleum, Mazar-e-Quaid, in Karachi.
